Small fillter size will keep edges but will effect the blending that we like poorly.
That make sence since we preserve high freq. 

A small filter size also means small windows which means small smoothness.

On the other hand using big filter size will result the oppsite we will hurt the
edges and blend them. But the blending effect will look more nice.
The reason is the size of the window which is bigh window
in convolution result in good smoothing.
