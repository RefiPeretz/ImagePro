If we get a segment with out pixcels it means that
for a given border z_i to z_i+1 when z represent index of pixcel from [0,255]
the sum of all the pixcel with value p > z_i and p <=  z_i+1 is 0 since there are no
pixcels over there. 
The new Q calculate for every iteration when in the formula we divide by the sum of 
pixcel we just discribed thus we can encounter in a division by zero.
Thats why every segement have to contains some pixcels
