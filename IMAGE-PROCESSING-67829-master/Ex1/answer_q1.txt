Question:
The quantization procedure needs an initial segment division of [0..255] to segments, z.
If a division will have a gray level segment with no pixels, the procedure will crash (Q1: Why?)

Answer:
The procedure will crash in such case obviously because we will divide by zero when we will try to calculate q_i -
dividing by the sum of the histogram values in that segment. Because this segment has no pixels, this sum of the
individual histogram vlaues (which are a sum of the pixels in each color level) is 0 thus we get division by zero.
