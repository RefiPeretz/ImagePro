Question:
    Why did you get two different magnitude images?

Answer:
    The difference is due to the fact that the convolution derivative (1, 0 ,-1) is an
    approximation of the derivative of the image. Thus we lose data! The derivative
    in the Fourier domain on the other hand is accurate, because we used a closed form formula that
    is mathematically accurate, and is not an approximation. We do not lose data, and for
    that reason the difference between the results.
