Question 1: Suggest how to use the workflow you have implemented in this assignment to train a network that
could be used for super-resolution
First we will need to implement some lower resolution function.
We use this function for the trainning and testing model.
The procees of this function: choose randomly a scale of the image we wish to down-sample to.
We do this with the same methods we used in the excersise, the gaussain kernel.
After the down scale the function will expand the image to the original size, we will return
the image with some resolution loss. Now we can use this function in order to train the desnosing model
which will return a trained super-resolution model and channels we used for the construction.

We give 24x24 patches to the  trainning function and we will use 48 channels for all
the layrs, all of them but the last one.
Using the corruption function we descripbed we will use the same variables as
in the excersize.
Using both, we will restore the courrupted image using the function restore_image
the trained model and the channels number and output super resolution image.
